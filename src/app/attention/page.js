            Often referred to as coconut dogs, Capybaras are giant rodents native to South America and 
            are highly social creatures that live near bodies of water.
            They are the largest living rodent with its closest relatives being guinea pigs and chinchillas. 
            WA is one of the few states where you can legally own
            a capybara &#40;I have yet to see one in person üòî&#41;.
